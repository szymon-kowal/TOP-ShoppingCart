# Shopping site

Welcome to shopping site, an interactive online shopping experience created as a part of The Odin Project course. The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring and purchasing products.

## Technologies Used

- React: For building the user interface.
- TypeScript: For adding type safety to the JavaScript code.
- HTML & CSS: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- Vite: For bundling and optimizing the application.
- React Router Dom: For managing navigation within the application.
- Axios: For making API requests.

## Running the Application Locally

Fork the repository, then clone it to your local machine. Navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Build the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Testing

This project is equipped with a robust testing suite to ensure functionality and performance:

- **Vitest**: For running unit and integration tests.
- **@testing-library/react**: For testing React components in a realistic environment.
- **Axios Mock Adapter**: For mocking API requests during tests.

To run the tests, use the command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Learning Objectives

- **React Component Lifecycle**: Understanding how useEffect hook works and managing state updates.
- **API Integration**: Fetching data from APIs and handling responses.
- **Testing React Applications**: Writing and running tests to ensure component reliability.

## Future Improvements

- **Refactoring for Performance**: Optimizing fetching data with useEffect.
- **Advanced State Management**: Implementing more complex state logic.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Adding more interactive features for users.
